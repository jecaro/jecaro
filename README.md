Hey :wave:

My name is Jean-Charles. I'm a software developer specifically interested in 
functional programming. I like to contribute to OSS and also to build my own 
software.

Here are a few cool projects I've done for my own needs:
- [diverk](https://github.com/jecaro/diverk/): An Android app to browse GitHub 
  repositories.
- [mprisqueeze](https://github.com/jecaro/mprisqueeze/): An [MPRIS] interface 
  for [squeezelite].
- [systranything](https://github.com/jecaro/systranything): Let you put 
  anything in your system tray.
- [circuix-sword](https://github.com/jecaro/circuix-sword/): nixos in a gameboy 
  shell.
- [hscalendar](https://github.com/jecaro/hscalendar): A Haskell/Elm webapp to 
  track time.
- [bigball](https://github.com/jecaro/bigball): Display the dependencies of a 
  Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.
- [pomodozig](https://github.com/jecaro/pomodozig): Terminal based pomodoro 
  timer.
- [htagcli](https://github.com/jecaro/htagcli): Command line audio tagger.

Or just for fun:

  solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) 
  challenge in Rust.

  interpreter.
- [wolfram](https://github.com/jecaro/wolfram): Elementary cellular automaton.
- [reflex-tutorial](https://github.com/jecaro/reflex-tutorial): The official 
  [tutorial](https://reflex-frp.org/tutorial) for 
  [reflex](https://reflex-frp.org/) along a few other interesting examples.

My [neovim] plugins:

  Fast feedback loop with [ghcid] or [ghciwatch].
